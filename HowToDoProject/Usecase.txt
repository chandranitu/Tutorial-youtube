1. Which carrier performs better?

select Year,Month,UniqueCarrier,sum(DepDelay) from air1987 where DepDelay > 0  group by Year,Month,UniqueCarrier,DepDelay;

2. When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?

select Year,Month,DayOfWeek,UniqueCarrier,sum(DepDelay) from air1987 where DepDelay > 0 group by Year,Month,DayOfWeek,UniqueCarrier,DepDelay;

3. Do older planes suffer more delays?

select UniqueCarrier,TailNum,LateAircraftDelay,sum(DepDelay) from air1987 where DepDelay > 0 group by UniqueCarrier,TailNum,LateAircraftDelay,DepDelay; 

4.Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? Are there critical links in the system?

select Year,Month,DayOfweek,Origin,Dest,ArrDelay,DepDelay from air1987 .... 

5.How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?

6.How well does weather predict plane delays?

7.Use spark graphx to find the top 10 flights between SFO and LAX which got diverted at least once in the months between June and Dec
Graph cites as vertices and the direct flight routes as edges between the vertices

select air.UniqueCarrier,air.FlightNum,air.Origin,air.Dest,air.diverted from air1987 as air where air.month>=6 and air.month<=12 and air.diverted=true and Origin='SFO' and Dest='LAX'order by air.year desc ,air.month desc limit 10;

8.Find out the top 5 most visited destinations.

9.Which month has seen the most number of cancellations due to bad weather?

10.Top ten origins with the highest AVG departure delay

11.Which route (origin & destination) has seen the maximum diversion?
